# Elytra-Client
Probably the worst shit I've ever made but this is a Client for EpicQuest.

* Once injected run the command `elytraon` and after that its your preference what you want to do, commands are listed below.

* `fov` - Toggles fov from 90 degrees to 180.
* `rapidfire` - Adds rapidfire to ArenaGuns and some Paintball weapons.
* `dev` - Enables developer and unity developer console.
* `god` - Makes local player invincible.
* `fly` - Enables fly.
* `bounds` - Places hitbox outside of bounds, good for respawning/killing yourself.
* `antigrab` - Disables item grabbing.
* `elytraon` - Initializes and starts elytra.
* `elytraoff` - Uninitializes and unloads dll.
  
You can inject this using process hacker, insane injector, dll injector, anything really that works for you.
